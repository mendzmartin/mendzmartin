# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
> Iâ€™m currently PhD Candidate of physics at Condensed Matter Theory Group (GTMC), Institute of Physics Enrique Gaviola (IFEG), [National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET)](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/) - [Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics and Computation Faculty (FaMAF), National University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC)](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/). Currently Iâ€™m learning quantum mechanics, quantum dots, quantum dynamics and computational physics. Therefore I'm looking for help with everything related to computational physics simulations that include parallel computation and quantum theoretical physics.
